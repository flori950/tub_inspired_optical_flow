# *Bio-Inspired Computer Vision:  Optical flow estimation using space-time separable filters*
This project is one part of the module: Bio-inspired computer vision and was implemented by Florian JÃ¤ger and Weijie Qi under Prof. Dr. Marianne Maertens and Prof. Guillermo Gallego.
  
### The folder contains the following:  

>-Event segmentation folder
>> In this part we try to split the motion, based on the data generated in the optical flow part using event segmentation

>-Optical flow folder:
>> This part of the project includes an improved version and improved understandability of the optical flow written by Bing Li
>> Please run this part of the project first so that you understand what data is used the Event Segmentation part 

>-Slides:
>> The presentaion of the results of the project
