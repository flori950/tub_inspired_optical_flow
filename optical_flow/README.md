# *Bio-Inspired Computer Vision:  BAYESIAN INFERENCE OF MODELS ON EVENT BASED OPTICAL FLOW TO SOLVE APERTURE PROBLEM*
This project is one part of the module: Bio-inspired computer vision and was implemented by Florian JÃ¤ger and Weijie Qi under Prof. Dr. Marianne Maertens and Prof. Guillermo Gallego.
  
### The folder contains the following:  


>-sources:
>>This folder contains the codes used for this part.
>>This is the folder contains the slides and the original jupyter notebook which explains some general ideas of this .project. Futhermore it has the implementation and usage of the temporal filter.


>-src:  
>>All code snippets are here.


> >main.py
> > > Main-file for running the code.
> > > This is where the code is executed.
> > > Please install Python to run the code.
> > > Open the folder you are right now in the command window and type "python main.py" with a command prompt which is able to compile python-files to start the program.
> > > Close the generated windows if you want to continue the program.
> > > Please also watch the terminal output to understand where the program is.
> > integrator_methods.py
> > global_params.py

### Changes to Bing Lis Code

>-Bing Lis Code:
> > Two input files (events, utils.py),
> > One Jupyter Notebook file where all methods are written,
> > No Connection to the output-folder in the code,
> > No usage of the kernels,
> > Kernels are stored in the same folder,
> > Rare Terminal outputs.

>-Why the Changes:
> > Easier to understand, change parameters, execute via terminal, (problems with executing parts of the code),
> > Faster (generating pictures).

>-Changes:
> > One global parameter file (many parameters were stored in the IPYNB),
> > Change the project to python only to be sure, tha each package could be read by the code,
> > Exclude all filter methods to a seperate file,
> > Exclude all integrator methods to a seperate file,
> > Using the generated kernels,
> > Generating a kernel folder, 
> > Generate the actual pictures to the output folder,
> > Adding terminal outputs for a better understanding of the code,
> > Image generatingduring runtime,
> > Changing the input parameters to get the wanted picture.

>-Added:
> > New gabor filter,
> > New temporal filter,
> > New bi and mono spacial filter,
> > New normalization Mehtods (Adding specific filter parameters).


## Results
The images show two waving hands that are moving in opposite horizontal directions original generated and normalized.
