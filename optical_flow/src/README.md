# *Bio-Inspired Computer Vision:  Optical flow estimation using space-time separable filters*
This project is one part of the module: Bio-inspired computer vision and was implemented by Florian JÃ¤ger and Weijie Qi under Prof. Dr. Marianne Maertens and Prof. Guillermo Gallego.   


### The repository contains the following:  

>-Python code:  folder:src
> > main.py
> > > Main-file for running the code
> > > This is where the code is executed
> > > Please install Python to run the code
> > > Open the folder you are in in the command window and type python main.py to start the program
> > > Close the generated windows if you want to continue the program
> > > Please also watch the terminal output to understand where the program is
> > integrator_methods.py
> > global_params.py
> > > change any parameter here and include it with "params.<variable/methodname>"
> > > change file locations (Kernel,events,...) here
> > filter_methods.py
> > > a.definitions of  spatial and temporal filters  
> > > b. visualization of filters above in 2d or 3d view
> > kernel folder
> > >all created kernels are stored here
> > >.npy files are the intermediate files  
> >__pycache__ folder
> > >compieled python methods in different python versions
> > >.npy files are the intermediate files

### As reminder that these folders are changed during runtime:  

>-[Dataset](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/datasets/davis/slider_far.zip):  
>>This is the dataset which is used in this project.For this dataset, only event.txt is used.

>-Figures:  
>> the generated figures are saved in the folder: output_figures  

>-Sources:
>>This is the folder contains the slides and the original jupyter notebook which explains some general ideas of this project. Futhermore it has the implementation and usage of the temporal filter
